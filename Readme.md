####  Purpose 

The purpose of creating my Portfolio Website is to showcase my skills and abilities as a Dev Profesional to pontential employers. 

####  Description/ Functionality 

My Portfolio Website has a minimalist aesthetic. Less is more, and i styled it in a way that draws user engagement to the information displayed. I've added a carousel feature on my projects page, a sleek way to display future projects.  

####  Sitemap

Below i've attached my xml site map along with the graphical site map. 
The site map is simple for now it includes a parent page and children pages. There are some pages missing which connect to the projects page but it is my intention to add those pages at a later date.

####  Target audience

My Portfolio website is intended for Potential Employers or fellow coders who wish to collaborate on projects. 

####  Tech stack 

For my Techstack, i used html, CSS and deployed it on GITHUB pages.
I utilized source control to back up my work on Github incase anything goes wrong to my original files. 
Also i made use of subsource integrity to prevent mal-practice on my code.


####  SlideDeck

Below i provide a link to my slide presentation which offers a walkthrough of my whole design process, including components used and aesthetics.
